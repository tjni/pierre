# Tooling and Dependencies

## Toolchain (proto)

- Tool versions (bun, node, moon, gh) are pinned in `.prototools` and managed by
  [proto](https://moonrepo.dev/docs/proto); its shims put the pinned versions on
  PATH inside the repo. `proto use` installs everything after a pin changes.
- Bump a tool by editing `.prototools` only — never install tools globally or
  pin versions elsewhere. moon's version is additionally enforced by
  `versionConstraint` in `.moon/workspace.yml` and mirrored as the
  `@moonrepo/cli` catalog entry (for Vercel builders without proto); keep all
  three in sync.
- CI and local shells resolve the same toolchain: CI installs it with
  `moonrepo/setup-toolchain`, which runs `proto install` against the same
  `.prototools`.

## Bun

- Use `bun` exclusively for commands and package operations.
- Do not use `npm`, `pnpm`, `npx`, or other package runners unless there is a
  specific reason and you explain it.
- Bun can run TypeScript directly, so local scripts may be `.ts` files without a
  separate compile step.

## Dependency Catalog

This monorepo uses Bun's `workspaces.catalog` in the root `package.json`.

- Never add a version directly to an individual package's `package.json` by
  default.
- To add a dependency:
  1. Add the exact version to the root `package.json` under
     `workspaces.catalog`, for example `"new-package": "1.2.3"`.
  2. Reference it from the package with `"new-package": "catalog:"`.
- Do not run `bun add <package>` inside a package directory; it writes direct
  versions and breaks the catalog pattern.
- Published packages may intentionally use ranges for end-user compatibility.
  `apps/docs` should use catalog versions; published packages such as
  `packages/diffs` may use ranges only when that is intentional.

## Tasks

- All build/dev/test/lint entrypoints are moon tasks; package.json scripts exist
  only for npm lifecycle hooks (`prepublishOnly`). Never add task scripts back
  to a package.json.
- Tasks are defined in `.moon/tasks/*.yml` (inherited) and each project's
  `moon.yml`. Repo-wide tooling (format, lint, icons, clean) lives on the `root`
  project.
- Run tasks from anywhere in the repo:

```bash
moon run <project>:<task>
moonx <project>:<task>             # shorthand for moon exec
moonx <project>:<task> -- --flags  # forward arguments after --
moon run :test                     # a task across every project that has it
moon tasks <project>               # discover a project's tasks
```

moon builds dependency projects first (`deps: ['^:build']`), caches outputs, and
skips tasks whose inputs have not changed. Local-only tasks set explicit options
instead of moon presets (presets force `runInCI: skip`, which moon refuses to
run in CI-detected shells; agent harnesses export `CI=1`):

- No graph edges at all (formatters, benchmarks, wt, servers spawned by
  playwright): use `runInCI: 'always'` — runnable everywhere, and never in the
  CI pipeline because a task with no deps or dependents is never affected
  through the graph.
- Connected to the build graph (dev/prod, e2e variants, publish guards): keep
  `runInCI: 'skip'` — `moon ci --include-relations` runs affected
  runInCI-enabled tasks even when unrequested, which would pull them into CI.
  Run them in CI-marked shells with a `CI=` prefix, e.g.
  `CI= moonx docs:dev-diffs` or `CI= bun publish --dry-run`.
